# Building your extension:

This fork of (kholmogorov27's project)[https://github.com/kholmogorov27/chevron] that packages the start page into an extension using webpack. To build and use Chevron as an extension, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Run `npm run build` to build the extension (this will create a `dist` folder)
4. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
5. Enable Developer Mode
6. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` folder.
7. When you open a new tab, you should see the Chevron extension in action!
